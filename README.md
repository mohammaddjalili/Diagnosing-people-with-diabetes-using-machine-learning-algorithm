# Diagnosing-people-with-diabetes-using-machine-learning-algorithm
In this project, we want to check whether the patient has diabetes by using machine learning classification algorithms.

First, we check the data set and then go to the data pre-processing to prepare the data set for modeling.

Then we perform several models using machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, and Random forest and check the accuracy of each one
