# Diagnosing-people-with-diabetes-using-machine-learning-algorithm
In this project, we want to check whether the patient has diabetes or not by using machine learning classification algorithms and existing dataset.
First, we check the data set and then we go to the data pre-processing to make the data set ready for modeling.
Then we perform several modeling using machine learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree and Random forest and check the accuracy of each one
